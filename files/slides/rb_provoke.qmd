 In (Transport) Geography, my ‘home’ discipline, the space for doing this form of pre-registration seems quite small.

Our attempts to quantify the impact of contraflow cycling infrastructure on observed cycle volumes and crashes, looking at 20+years of data in London.  

Lots of thinking to derive outcome variables that made sense. 

For example, non-straightforward decisions around infrastructure data; linking estimates of recorded crashes and modelled cycle counts (exposure) to sections of infrastructure; allocating linked crashes to pre- and post- infrastructure periods.

* Traffic Regulation Orders

Each of these analysis steps were implemented quite differently to what was laid out in our initial research design.

Separate from this was the muddiness of the ‘global’ statistics used to claim findings: those estimating change in cycling rates and crash risk pre- and post- infrastructure. 

When disaggregating by different context variables, we found that these estimated rates varied enormously, including directionally.

 The assumption baked into the statistics presented in our analysis was that random differences in context ‘balance out’ in our global-level statistic.  
 
 It didn’t take much thinking-time for us to loose faith in this assumption. 
 
 So key findings were presented with corresponding levels of humility; our analysis of cycling volumes and contraflow emphasised more descriptive elements of the analysis.

The provocation gives license to doing and publishing exploratory work that seeks to describe processes, interactions, relationships in rich detail. 


This emphasis on rich description might seem overly “qualitative” and at odds with the scientific method. 

In fact, it invites us to think causally about the phenomena under observation. 

By characterising in detail the context under which some events happen, and do not happen, we naturally begin to think about how events were generated, the regularity with which they appear. 

The challenge becomes how to represent (tools) and evaluate (statistical models) this detailed /rich space of context-dependent outcomes -- some of which we don't have data for -- in a reasonably formal, standardised and accessible way.
