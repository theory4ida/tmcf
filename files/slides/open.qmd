Road Crash Analysis project with DfT
Stats19 -- the road safety dataset for UK

A loose brief: 
1. between-area comparison in crash rates -- monitoring 
2. thematic analysis on under-analysed sections of the dataset.

Presribed recipe for doing analysis:

Exploratory > Pre-register ? Test


At the time, 2020–2, conscious of Science Reform -- for establishing empirical rigour… as a response to replication crisis –– 

Have a draft pre-registration report/proposal looking at autobesity and injury severity -- but this didn't get far. 

Essentially because our exploratory analysis threw up so many things that undermined our initial plans 
-- generated findings that at a high-level would look compelling (p-values etc.), but when properly scrutinised would fall apart

And so instead we pushed our exploratory analysis in various directions, using combinations of models and data graphics in tandem -- in a way that geographers often do, but that you tend not to see in data analysis primers.

Way of analysis resonated with commentary papers --  broadside / critique at these tenets of science reform ...re-looking at / elevating exploratory analysis approaches – that they are essentially about generating and evaluating models (where most analytic activity happens) ...

> EDA is often thought of as an alternative to model-based statistical analysis, but once we think of **graphs as comparisons to models**, it makes sense that the amount we've learned increases with the complexity of the model being compared to. **Effective graphics** create visual structures that **enable model inspection** by foregrounding comparisons of interest in ways that exploit the abilities of the human visual system

# Research agenda for exploratory research

Amazingly, we’ve managed to bring in people who have very eloquently defined this problem space, and are the obvious experts that have been pushing this alternative/modern/realistic reading of data analysis

This speaks to tension that the TMCF is concerned with: balancing depth/richness in context – descriptive detail – with rigour (repeatable methods, judgements of how stable are observations, how regularly/consistently they occur)

So it is this tension that informs those Provocations – we think they push at this from different angles – and really that motivates this TMCF

## Themes

::: {style="font-size: 85%"}

* **Modelling paradigms**: establish what is distinctive about modelling in data-driven science by mapping out archetypal data-driven projects and the analysis practices they use.

* **Inference and replicability**: develop ways of documenting the context under which analytical findings are made – a grammar for structuring exploratory research findings – so that inferences can be more formally reported.


* **Tools** for progressing **from analysis to communication**: documenting interactive data analysis processes with integrity – balancing claims to knowledge with informational complexity.

# Provocations and Themes

::: {.notes}

Provocations and position statements as a launch-pad. These are necessarily discursive and probably cover things that we've variously read and are aware of

From here, self-organise into groups for preparing blog posts – in these we want to generate material, discussion points and examples/evidence for the Commentary Paper

What would be great is if we can take these and for each map them to example -- ultimately think about protocols / recipes / frameworks and/or applied examples.



:::

---

![](img/programme.png){.absolute top=10 left=0 width="90%"}

::: {.notes}

To achieve this: structured activities, aimed to generate material and evidence that we can use to create these outputs.

Flexibility in how TMCFs operate, in activities undertaken.

But ambitions in terms of outputs:  

1. Commentary paper in RSS / Harvard Data Science Review / Other;  and 

2. SI papers that take,  extend, exemplify research agenda outlined in Commentary paper.
